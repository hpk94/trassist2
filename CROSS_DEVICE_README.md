# Cross-Device Trade State Management

This document explains the new cross-device trade state functionality that allows the latest uploaded trade to remain active across different devices until it is canceled.

## 🎯 Overview

The system now maintains persistent trade state using a SQLite database, ensuring that:

- **Latest uploaded trade stays active** until explicitly canceled
- **Same state across all devices** accessing the same server
- **Real-time updates** when trades are created or canceled
- **Complete trade history** for audit and analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with two main tables:

1. **`trades`** - Stores trade information and current status
2. **`trade_history`** - Tracks all changes and actions

### Key Components

- **`database.py`** - Database management and trade state persistence
- **`web_app.py`** - Updated Flask app with new API endpoints
- **SQLite Database** - Local file-based storage (`trades.db`)

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Active Trade Management
- Only one trade can be active at a time
- New uploads automatically replace the previous active trade
- Active trade status is visible on all devices

### 2. Cross-Device Synchronization
- All devices see the same active trade
- Changes made on one device are immediately visible on others
- No manual synchronization required

### 3. Trade Lifecycle
- **Created** - When a new chart is uploaded and analyzed
- **Active** - Currently being monitored (default status)
- **Canceled** - Manually canceled by user
- **Completed** - Trade execution completed
- **Replaced** - Superseded by a newer trade

### 4. API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/active-trade` | GET | Get currently active trade |
| `/api/cancel-trade` | POST | Cancel active trade |
| `/api/trade-history` | GET | Get trade history |
| `/api/all-trades` | GET | Get all trades with pagination |
| `/api/update-trade-status` | POST | Update specific trade status |

## 📱 User Interface Updates

### Active Trade Status Panel
- Shows current active trade information
- Displays trade ID, symbol, timeframe, direction, status
- Includes creation and update timestamps
- Cancel button to terminate active trade

### Real-time Updates
- Page automatically refreshes active trade status
- New uploads immediately update the active trade display
- Cancellation is reflected across all devices instantly

## 🔧 Setup and Usage

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
python web_app.py
```

### 2. Access the Web Interface
Open your browser to `http://localhost:5001`

### 3. Upload a Chart
- Select a trading chart image
- Click "Analyze Chart"
- Wait for analysis to complete
- The trade becomes the new active trade

### 4. Cross-Device Testing
- Open the same URL on different devices/browsers
- All devices will show the same active trade
- Any device can cancel the active trade

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Test
Run the cross-device test script:
```bash
python test_cross_device.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the web app on one device
2. Upload a chart image
3. Open the same URL on another device
4. Verify both devices show the same active trade
5. Cancel the trade from one device
6. Verify the other device shows no active trade

## 📊 Database Management

### Database File
- Location: `trades.db` (in the project root)
- Format: SQLite database
- Backup: Copy the file to backup trade history

### Data Persistence
- All trade data is stored locally
- Survives application restarts
- Can be shared across devices on the same network

### Cleanup
The system includes automatic cleanup of old trades:
```python
# Clean up trades older than 30 days
db.cleanup_old_trades(days_old=30)
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Local Database
- SQLite database is stored locally
- No external database dependencies
- Data remains on your machine

### Network Access
- Web app runs on `0.0.0.0:5001` (accessible from network)
- Consider firewall rules for production use
- No authentication implemented (add if needed)

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Local Network
- Run on one machine
- Access from other devices on same network
- All devices share the same database file

### Option 2: Cloud Database
- Replace SQLite with cloud database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Deploy web app to cloud service
- Access from anywhere with internet

### Option 3: File Sharing
- Share the `trades.db` file across devices
- Each device runs its own web app instance
- Database file synchronization required

## 🔧 Configuration

### Database Path
Modify the database location in `database.py`:
```python
DATABASE_PATH = "path/to/your/trades.db"
```

### API Endpoints
All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/` and return JSON responses.

### Error Handling
- All API calls include success/error status
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Graceful handling of missing data

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **User Authentication** - Add login system
2. **Real-time Notifications** - WebSocket updates
3. **Trade Execution** - Automatic order placement
4. **Advanced Analytics** - Trade performance metrics
5. **Mobile App** - Native mobile application
6. **Cloud Sync** - Automatic cloud backup

### Scalability
- Current design supports single-user scenarios
- For multi-user, add user authentication
- For high volume, consider Redis or cloud database

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Locked**
   - Ensure only one web app instance is running
   - Check file permissions on `trades.db`

2. **API Not Responding**
   - Verify web app is running on correct port
   - Check firewall settings

3. **Cross-Device Not Working**
   - Ensure devices are on same network
   - Use correct IP address instead of localhost

### Debug Mode
Enable Flask debug mode for detailed error messages:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
```

## 📝 API Examples

### Get Active Trade
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/active-trade
```

### Cancel Active Trade
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/cancel-trade \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "Canceled via API"}'
```

### Get Trade History
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/trade-history
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

The cross-device trade state management system provides:

✅ **Persistent trade state** across devices  
✅ **Real-time synchronization** of trade status  
✅ **Simple API** for programmatic access  
✅ **Complete audit trail** of all trade actions  
✅ **Easy deployment** with minimal dependencies  

This implementation ensures that your latest uploaded trade remains active and accessible from any device until you explicitly cancel it, providing a seamless multi-device trading experience.
