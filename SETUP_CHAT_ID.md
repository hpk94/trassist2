# Get Your Telegram Chat ID - Step by Step

You already have your bot token ‚úÖ. Now you just need your **Chat ID**.

## Quick Method (Easiest) - 2 Minutes

### Step 1: Use @userinfobot
1. Open Telegram (phone or desktop)
2. Search for: **@userinfobot**
3. Start a chat and send **any message**
4. The bot will reply with your info, including your **ID** number
5. **Copy that ID number** ‚Üê This is your TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID!

### Step 2: Add to .env file
Open `/Users/hpk/trassist2/.env` and add this line:

```bash
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=YOUR_ID_NUMBER_HERE
```

For example, if your ID is `987654321`:
```bash
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=987654321
```

### Step 3: Restart server
```bash
./start_server.sh
```

### Step 4: Test it!
```bash
python test_telegram.py
```

## Alternative Method - Using Your Bot

If @userinfobot doesn't work, use this method:

### Step 1: Message your bot
1. Open Telegram
2. Search for **your bot** (the one you created with @BotFather)
3. Start a chat and send: **/start** or **Hello**

### Step 2: Run the helper script
```bash
python get_chat_id.py
```

This will fetch your chat ID from your bot's messages.

### Step 3: Copy the chat ID
The script will show you your Chat ID. Copy it.

### Step 4: Add to .env file
```bash
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=YOUR_ID_HERE
```

### Step 5: Restart and test
```bash
./start_server.sh
python test_telegram.py
```

---

## Your .env file should look like this:

```bash
# Telegram Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8433274774:AAHa3bKiR... (already set ‚úÖ)
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=987654321 (‚Üê add this line)

# Other configurations...
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No messages found"
- Make sure you sent a message to your bot first
- Try sending another message
- Wait a few seconds and try again

### "Bot not responding"
- Make sure you're messaging the correct bot
- Check the bot username matches what @BotFather gave you
- Try the @userinfobot method instead

### Still stuck?
Run the config check:
```bash
python check_telegram_config.py
```

---

## What happens next?

Once you add the TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID:
1. ‚úÖ Images uploaded will appear in Telegram
2. ‚úÖ Analysis results will be sent to Telegram
3. ‚úÖ Trade signals will notify you in Telegram

Ready? Add that Chat ID and restart the server! üöÄ
